                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>In my free time, I find myself drawn to both the great outdoors and immersive digital worlds. Hiking is one of my favorite ways to recharge and stay connected to nature. I love exploring new trails, taking in scenic views, and finding moments of quiet away from the rush of daily life. The physical challenge of hiking, combined with the reward of reaching a summit or scenic overlook, makes it an incredibly fulfilling experience.</p>

                <p>When I’m indoors, gaming and coding allow me to dive into complex and engaging worlds. Gaming has been a lifelong passion, giving me a chance to experience different narratives and challenge my strategic thinking. Coding, on the other hand, is both a hobby and a skill I’m constantly developing. I enjoy solving problems, creating projects, and learning new languages that push my abilities. I’m also passionate about lifelong learning, whether that means picking up new skills in technology, exploring interesting topics, or honing my knowledge across a range of subjects.</p>
